intro:
  - excerpt: "**ABOUT ME:**
  I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The Pennsylvania State University.
  I am a member of the BioRob-InFL Lab, advised by Prof. Bo Cheng and Prof. Jean-Michel Mongeau.
  My research interests lie in exploring the embodied intelligence that exists throughout nature—emerging from the interaction between an agent 
  (whether a robot or a biological being) and its environment—shaped by a long history of evolution."
